Hey there! My name is Anurag Mukherjee, and I'm a third-year CSE student exploring the fascinating world of data analytics and its applications in various domains. 
I'm particularly interested in leveraging data to uncover meaningful insights, drive informed decision-making, and solve complex problems.
This repository serves as a showcase of my data-related projects and skills.
